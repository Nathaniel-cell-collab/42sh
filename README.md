# 42sh - A Unix Shell in C

## ðŸ“– Description

42sh is a project aimed at reproducing a basic Unix shell coded in the C programming language. It supports command execution, process management, input/output redirections, pipes, environment variables, and other fundamental features of a standard Unix shell.
